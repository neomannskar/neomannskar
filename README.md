## Hi there üëã

Visit my site: [neo.mannskar.com](https://neo.mannskar.com/).

I'm a passionate developer, entrepreneur, and game engine enthusiast currently in my third year of Design and Product Development at NTI Gymnasiet in Sundsvall. My work revolves around technology, innovation, and building ambitious projects from the ground up.
üí° What I Do

### Game Development & Engine Programming
I'm the project lead at Ashen Interactive, a game studio focused on creating a unique horror experience. Alongside game development, we're building our own in-house game engine in Rust using Vulkan for high-performance rendering.

### Full-Stack Development & Entrepreneurship
As a co-founder of Studypal UF, an award-winning startup, I work on both administration and marketing while developing an online platform where students can book private tutoring sessions. This is a full-stack project built from scratch with my co-founder.

### Systems Programming & Low-Level Development
I enjoy working close to the hardware, whether it's writing C and Rust, developing a C compiler for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, or experimenting with assembly programming.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Interests

Programming Languages: Rust, C, C++, Python, Java, Assembly
Game Engines: Custom engine development, OpenGL, Vulkan
Tools & Technologies: Linux (Hyprland), Git, multithreading, ECS
